# EmotionsNLP

### By Larry Feng

For my final project, I chose a dataset on Kaggle about Natural Language Processing (NLP), https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp. The data is all text data that contains sentences with some type of emotion: anger, sadness, joy, suprise, and love. These sentences could also contain slang or internet abbreviations, i.e. because => bcoz, you => u. This is quite a large dataset as well, with over a couple hundred lines of sentences, so hopefully, I will be able to get more accurate results. For this project I plan to create an NLP model to analyze the data and accurate classify the data as some kind of emotion. I plan to use tokenization and NER to train a pipeline in spaCy. The goal of this project is to accurately identify the emotion present within the text through training a pipeline and validating our results with test data. Although this is my current plan, my method of modeling the data may change.
