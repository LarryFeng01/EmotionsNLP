# Classifying Emotions in Text with Deep Learning and Neural Networks
### By Larry Feng

## Introduction

For my final project, I chose a dataset on Kaggle about Natural Language Processing (NLP), https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp. Emotion: Instinctive or intuitive feeling as distinguised from reasoning or knowledge. They can be found in verbal conversations or in text. For this project I will be focusing on text data. Emotions reflect different perspectives for an action, so they are innately expressed in "dynamic linguistic forms". And, accurately capturing these linguistic forms is difficult because of our ever-growing language, which is full of slang and context. For example, the sentence: "i still love my so and wish the best for him..." is categorized as sadness. But, if we parse through this sentence word by word, this sentence would not make sense in formal English. This is because of the abbreviation so => S.O. => Significant Other, which is basically an abbreviation for romantic partner. But, how would an algorithm know that? Well, I will be using Deep Learning and Neural Network methods to train a model so that it can learn these 

## Data

The data is all text data that contains sentences with some type of emotion: anger, sadness, joy, suprise, and love.
